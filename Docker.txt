Docker:

	Docker is an open source centralized platform designed to create, deploy and run application.
	
	Docker uses container on the host OS to run applications.it allows applications to use the same linux kernel as system on the host computer rather than creating a whole virtual OS.
	
	we can install docker on any OS but docker engine runs natively on linux distribution.
	
	Docker written in google go laguage.
	
	Docker is a tool that performs OS level virtualization also known as containerization.
	
	before docker many users faces problem that a particular code is running in developer's system but not in the users system.
	
	docker was first relased in marcj 2013.
	
	Docker is a set of platform as a service that uses OS levele virtualization where as VMWare uses Hardwarelevel Virtualization.

what was the challenge?
	1.Compatability/Dependency
	2.Long set up time of required s/w
	3.Different dev/text/prod evironment.
	
How to solve this problem:
	1.containerize application.
	2.run each application solely in seperate container.
	
So what is container?
	isolated environment with processing with different network/mounts.
	
	shares same OS karnel(OS in Linux).
	
	Stack will be like below:
	
	-----------------------------------
	|Application+   |  Application+   |
	|Lib+dependency |  Libs+Dependency| 
	-----------------------------------
	          Docker Engine
	-----------------------------------
                     OS
	-----------------------------------
	       Hardware Infrasturcture
	-----------------------------------
	
Advantages of Docker:
	
	1.No Pre allocation of RAM
	
	2.CI efficiency->docker enables you ro build a container image and use that same image across every step of the deployment process.
	
	3.less cost
	
	4.light weight
	
	5.can run on physical H/W ,Virtual H/W or on cloud
	
	5.you can re-use the image
	
	6.it takes very less time to create container.
	
	
Limitation:

	1.both dev and test OS must be same then image will work.
	
	likewise dev has created in Ubuntu and testing using centos then it will not work.
	
	2.cross platform compatability.
	
	
	
DockerHub: 
	Central Repo for Docker;

Docker Image:
	Package or template to create one or more container.
	
In windows docker installed in Liux VM.

Docker Cmd:

docker version
docker images
docker run ubuntu
docker run -it ubuntu
docker stats
docker system df
docker ps -aq(all running docker container)
docker system prune
